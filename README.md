# React / TypeScript / Vite Boilerplate with Tailwind CSS

## Overview

This project is a template for kickstarting React applications with Vite as the build tool, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for a utility-first CSS framework. It also includes Prettier for code formatting, PostCSS for transforming styles, SWC as the JavaScript compiler, and prettier-plugin-tailwindcss for sorting Tailwind classes.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated frontend build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and visually consistent designs.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent coding style.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming styles with JavaScript plugins.
- **SWC**: A fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler.
- **prettier-plugin-tailwindcss**: A Prettier plugin for sorting Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Linting**: Integrated ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting.
- **Husky/lint-staged**: Automatically runs eslint and prettier before every commit.
